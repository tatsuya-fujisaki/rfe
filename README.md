# Demo
# Features

Physics_Sim_Py used [pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) only.

```python
import pyxel
```
[Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) is a retro game engine for Python.
You can feel free to enjoy making pixel art style physics simulations.

# Requirement

* Python 3.sample
* pyxel 1.sample

Environments under [Anaconda for Windows](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is tested.

```bash
conda create -n pyxel pip python=3.6 Anaconda
activate pyxel
```

# Installation

Install Pyxel with pip command.

```bash
pip install pyxel
```

# Usage

Please create python code named "demo.py".
And copy &amp; paste [Day4 tutorial code](https://cpp-learning.com/pyxel_physical_sim4/).

Run "demo.py"

```bash
python demo.py
```
